2. shuffler_code.py ---->It shuffles the words for better memory testing
3. word_list.txt  ----> contains the word with meanings (800 words total)
4. w2m.npy ----> Stores your memory for each word2meaning
5. m2w.npy ----> Stores your memory for each meaning2word
6. new_user.py ----> Cleares the memory_matrix(w2m.npy and m2w.npy) of the previous user
7. barron_quiz_master.py ----> Main file which ties the other files together. 

How to use:

2. Run the barron_quiz_master.py
3. repeat step-2, until you master the entire word list!!
